# MagicMirror-API

Like pretty much everyone else on the planet, my first Raspberry Pi project was a
Magic Mirror with a spare monitor and a two-way mirror. This application supports
that mirror by communicating with my to-do list app, an open trivia database, and
Dark Sky's API (presumably I got grandfathered in when they were acquired by Apple,
but I'll have to find a new weather API by the end of 2021).
